# In Progress

This repository is a collection of my solutions to each of the challenges given on the [HDLBits Website](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page). Note that these aren't necessarily the best optimized solutions, just solutions I came up with while working through the problems. I started this repository as a way to track my progress through several Verilog challenges, better improving my understanding of the language.

Any folder ending with (NOT STARTED) signifies that section of the challenges has not been started at all, while folders ending with (IN PROGRESS) signifies that section of challenges has been started but not yet completed. Otherwise assume everything within that folder is completed. I'll update this repository as I continue to progress through the challenges.
