# In Progress

This repository is a collection of my solutions to each of the challenges given on the [HDLBits Website](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page). Note that these aren't necessarily the best optimized solutions, just solutions I came up with while working through the problems. I started this repository as a way to track my progress through several Verilog challenges, better improving my understanding of the language.

I'll update this repository as I continue to progress through the challenges.
